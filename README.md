## Description

The tech blog is a destination for users to create blog posts to share information about computer programming as well as web and software development. The site requires the user to be logged on to use its features. The user is able to write a blog post from their dashboard. This includes a title and a body of text. Posts are then displayed on the homepage with the author and date they were created. Users are also able to post comments to the articles which will display their names and the dates the comments were added.

## Usage
